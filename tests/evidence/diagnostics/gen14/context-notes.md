Generation 14 replaces only the BDS60 rounded IAS/Mach threshold decision with a proved exact integer enclosure. The caller forms the exact rational IAS/Mach ratio after the unchanged availability and positive-Mach guards. The helper certifies definitely outside or inclusive-inside results with integer arithmetic; uncertain cases retain the original software-binary64 rounding and strict comparisons. The equality holds for every rational, including exact thresholds and values that round back onto them. [Source/native review](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/source-review.json) retains the fresh timed-worker C and actual conditional fallback assembly.

The helper uses arbitrary-precision Int operations as needed, not a fixed-width or allocation-free path. Exact normalized Rat division remains in cbPenalty before the helper, and the original software round remains at one conditional native call site. BDS50 wind/turn logic, field-code tables, semantic statuses and every other production path are unchanged from generation 13, as recorded by the source review. No measured instruction delta is treated as a timing explanation for the generation-14 benchmark regression.

The diagnostic checkout and original timed generation-14 commit are both `cd749c8192a77a79ba683303f0b743f04ff6bc0c`. The driver reuses all production objects from the exact 22-set fresh benchmark inventory, with unchanged source/C/object/trace and binary hashes. No historical attribution remapping is needed for this generation. The benchmark remains a separate measurement; these counters are not throughput samples.

The live UInt32 loop, syndrome, checksum, byte fold, frame field extractor and field-packing helper are retained as explicit nested anchors. The old standalone Parity.step boundary is absent because its update is inlined; absence is not zero work. The byte prefix and original arbitrary-precision byte-fold boundaries are explicit comparison rows. The latter is reachable only for input lists longer than sixteen bytes, outside the accepted 7/14-byte corpus. Incoming inclusive costs overlap each other and the exclusive stages; they are not additive subdivisions. Whole-message output construction, semantic affine guards, machine-word field extraction and exact integer score decisions remain live.

One syndrome is computed for each successfully parsed corpus frame and reused through acceptance, report and address recovery. The separate post-collection CRC census checks all 172,432 accepted corpus frames against retained outputs. Its bit-update count is a prediction from widths, not a native step-call measurement. The observed UInt32 loop has one entry per syndrome. This accepted corpus does not measure rejection paths or arbitrary huge widths; those may retain arbitrary-precision index operations and allocations. Rational center/envelope/mass remain reference APIs used by the post-collection score census. Integer choose/common-denominator/pair-fold and lazy fallback entries are reconciled with the separately checked register populations.

All immutable density, Mach, QNH and wind-penalty tables initialize before main. Scalar lazy constants can initialize on early collected calls, and each process has its own allocator state; no unmeasured correction is applied. The persistent tables depend only on format/field codes, never messages or corpus contents. Missing standalone or inlined helper boundaries do not imply zero computation.

Native perf recording completed before any native census or Callgrind worker began. Family/probe profiles intentionally overlapped with at most six active workers. Other agents performed read-only reviews; no host-wide isolation is claimed. Of 251 samples, 87 have a visible decoder ancestor and 164 are excluded; 249 stacks contain an unknown frame and 5 included leaves are unknown. These conditional observations cannot reliably allocate whole-decoder time. Capture conditions and loss counters are retained in [perf/README.md](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/perf/README.md).

The helper comparison retains actual per-stage native entries, self counts and incoming inclusive edge totals for both generations. Recursive/re-entrant calls can overlap within an inclusive row, and descendants can cross a later stage boundary. Only the exact self-event stage partition is additive. No instruction delta is interpreted as a predicted speedup. No production, proof or frozen source changed during collection.

Byte-helper native entries reconcile with the separately checked corpus lengths:

| Family | 7-byte frames | 14-byte frames | bytesValue entries | Prefix entries | >16-byte fallback entries |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| adsb | 0 | 50,385 | 50,385 | 50,385 | 0 |
| commb | 0 | 47,714 | 47,714 | 47,714 | 0 |
| other | 71,639 | 2,694 | 74,333 | 2,694 | 0 |

These boundary counts do not measure the inlined byte-update iterations, which remain live inside bytesValue. The arbitrary-length fallback is outside this corpus, not removed. The exact count reconciliation is retained in [byte-native-counts.json](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/byte-native-counts.json).

The live `cbPenalty` boundary in each supplemental register probe:

| Probe | Probe entries | Penalty entries | Penalty self Ir | Penalty incoming inclusive Ir | Whole probe Ir |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| candidate40 | 47,166 | 15,513 | 434,364 | 434,364 | 553,010,678 |
| candidate44 | 47,166 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 48,343,346 |
| candidate45 | 47,166 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 48,439,482 |
| candidate50 | 47,166 | 10,641 | 1,300,204 | 151,247,122 | 754,738,820 |
| candidate60 | 47,166 | 19,356 | 2,429,938 | 369,716,953 | 1,090,748,966 |
| score40 | 15,513 | 15,513 | 434,364 | 434,364 | 381,702,319 |
| score44 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score45 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score50 | 10,641 | 10,641 | 1,300,204 | 151,233,609 | 511,406,971 |
| score60 | 19,356 | 19,356 | 2,429,938 | 369,869,842 | 899,586,108 |

Candidate and score probes are overlapping views, not additive stages. Candidate probes include register hard checks and conditional scoring; score probes select the reached-score population before entering the collected root. Each inclusive penalty count includes its descendants and is not an additional cost to add to the whole probe or whole decoder. Exact rows are retained in [penalty-probe-costs.json](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/penalty-probe-costs.json).

The retained live wind lookup and eager table construction are distinguished explicitly:

| Profile | Expected lookup calls | Observed lookup calls | Lookup self Ir | Lookup incoming inclusive Ir | Entry construction inside root |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| adsb | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| commb | 10,641 | 10,641 | 678,708 | 3,048,948 | 0 |
| other | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| candidate40 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| candidate44 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| candidate45 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| candidate50 | 10,641 | 10,641 | 678,708 | 3,048,948 | 0 |
| candidate60 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score40 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score44 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score45 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| score50 | 10,641 | 10,641 | 678,708 | 3,048,948 | 0 |
| score60 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The expected lookup population includes reached BDS50 scores and any lazy fallback calls, checked separately after collection. Construction happens before the measured decoder root; its zero observed root entries are not a zero startup-cost claim. Inclusive lookup costs overlap the penalty and whole-profile costs. Exact reconciliation is retained in [wind-native-counts.json](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/wind-native-counts.json).

The BDS60 ratio enclosure and its observed software-round fallback:

| Profile | Ratio entries | Definite shortcuts | Software-round fallback entries | Ratio self Ir | Ratio incoming inclusive Ir | Fallback incoming inclusive Ir |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| adsb | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| commb | 17,394 | 17,386 | 8 | 4,593,636 | 159,064,887 | 242,334 |
| other | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| candidate60 | 17,394 | 17,386 | 8 | 4,593,636 | 158,990,130 | 242,415 |
| score40 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| score60 | 17,394 | 17,386 | 8 | 4,593,636 | 159,565,833 | 242,664 |

These are actual incoming helper and direct helper-to-round call records. The retained native CFG proves a single conditional round site; the shortcut count is helper entries minus those observed round entries. It is not a prediction of unseen input populations. Candidate and score probes overlap each other and the family profiles; all inclusive columns are non-additive. The retained [ratio-native-contexts.json](../tests/evidence/diagnostics/gen14/ratio-native-contexts.json) also records generation 13 and 14 cbPenalty direct edges, including old Binary64.div and new exact Rat.div plus enclosure. The old rounded divide already included exact division and rounding; do not add its descendants twice or infer wall-clock effects.
